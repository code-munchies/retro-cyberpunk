# State of Mind

State of Mind is a retro cyberpunk-themed website designed to mimic the aesthetics of the 1980s cyberpunk movement while integrating modern animations and frameworks. The site serves as a platform for users to post and comment on information and knowledge, embracing the ethos of free information and decentralization.

## Overview

State of Mind leverages a combination of modern web technologies to create an immersive retro-futuristic experience. The architecture is built using a React frontend with Vite for fast development and hot reloading. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express, and MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database. The styling incorporates Bootstrap for responsive design and Three.js for 3D effects.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: Web server framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to work in an asynchronous environment.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript 3D library for creating 3D effects.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end component library for responsive design.

### Project Structure

The project is structured to separate concerns clearly, with distinct folders for components, styles, and configurations:

- `.eslintrc.cjs`: Configuration for ESLint.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `index.html`: Main entry point for the project.
- `package.json`: Node.js package metadata file.
- `public/.gitkeep`: Empty file to keep the public directory in version control.
- `src/`: Contains all source code including components, styles, and main entry points.
  - `components/`: React components such as `LoginPage`, `MainScreen`, `ControlPanel`, etc.
  - `styles/`: Global styling rules.
  - `main.jsx`: Main entry point for the React application.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.

## Features

- **Retro Cyberpunk Aesthetics**: Neon colors, dark backgrounds, and blocky fonts to mimic the 1980s cyberpunk style.
- **Cryptic Login Screen**: A login screen that mimics security but allows any input to proceed.
- **Control Panel Interface**: A main screen designed as a retro-futuristic control panel.
- **Post and Comment System**: Users can post and comment on various topics.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, glitch effects, and 3D animations to enhance the user experience.
